Everyone knows the struggle with *"Where should we go for lunch today?"* We aim to provide a quick and easy fix for that with the *Lunch Application*.

*Lunch Application* is a simple app which provides the user with a randomized lunch restaurant from the Helsinki centrum. Just open up the app, press a button and you'll know where and what to eat today.

Production-ready/Staging version of the application is available at [lunch-application.herokuapp.com](https://lunch-application.herokuapp.com) *(Heroku)*

 - Using TDD for new and updated features is the favored workflow
 - Untested code should never be pushed/merged to master. PRs should not be accepted unless code is tested properly
